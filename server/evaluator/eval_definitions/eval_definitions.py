complexity_definition = (
    "A task is considered complex if it cannot be accomplished in simple steps, "
    "can be further decomposed into multiple sub-tasks, or requires specialized knowledge, "
    "multi-step reasoning, or layered concepts to complete. Otherwise, it's considered not complex."
)
coherence_definition = (
    "Two tasks are considered coherent in a sequence if the second "
    "logically or thematically follows from the first, maintains consistency with it, "
    "and does not present a contradictory or unrelated concept."
)
importance_definition = (
    "A subtask is considered important if it is critical, essential, "
    "or significantly beneficial to achieving the final goal. If it is tangential, "
    "optional, or has minimal impact, then it is not important."
