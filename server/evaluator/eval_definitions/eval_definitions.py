complexity_definition = (
    "A task is considered complex if it cannot be accomplished in one single text analysis step and "
    "should be further decomposed into multiple sub-tasks, each done by a single model or technique. Otherwise, it's considered not complex."
)
coherence_definition = (
    "Two tasks are considered coherent in a sequence if the second "
    "logically or thematically follows from the first, maintains consistency with it, "
    "and does not present a contradictory or unrelated concept."
)
importance_definition = (
    "A subtask is considered important if it is critical, essential, "
    "or significantly beneficial to achieving the final goal from the perspective of text analytics. "
    "If it is about social aspects or communication, or other "
