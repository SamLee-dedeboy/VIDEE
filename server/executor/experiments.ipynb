      "{'documents': [{'id': '0', 'content': 'Budget to set scene for election\\n \\n Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour\\'s bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n \\n Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n \\n - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n  - A freeze on petrol duty \\n  - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n  - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties\\' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government\\'s tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n \\n The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n \\n But Mr Brown\\'s former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don\\'t accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n \\n For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru\\'s economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to Â£5.60 an hour.\\n', 'summary': \"Gordon Brown is set to present his ninth Budget, emphasizing economic stability as Labour's key strategy for a third term in office. Key proposals include freezing petrol duty, raising the stamp duty threshold from £60,000, extending tax credits for low-income families, and potential aid for pensioners. While Brown aims to address concerns for first-time home buyers and mitigate tax burdens, opposition parties—including the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats—accuse Labour of hidden tax increases and caution about rising personal debt levels potentially jeopardizing economic stability.\", 'explanation': \"The text discusses the upcoming Budget presentation by Gordon Brown, focusing on various economic measures intended to position Labour favorably ahead of elections. It highlights key proposals meant to enhance home-buying accessibility and provide support for families, all while facing criticism from opposition parties who argue that Labour's policies may lead to increased taxes and financial instability. The summary encapsulates the main intentions and criticisms surrounding the Budget, reflecting the political context in which it is framed.\"}, {'id': '1', 'content': 'Army chiefs in regiments decision\\n \\n Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland\\'s Army regiments.\\n \\n A committee of the Army Board, which is made up of the most senior defence figures, will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on Monday. The proposals include cutting Scotland\\'s six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. The plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. The committee\\'s decision must be ratified by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It is expected that it will be made public next week. When ministers announced a reorganisation of the Army it drew a question mark over the futures of the Black Watch, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King\\'s Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.\\n \\n Under their vision, it would be one of five in the new super regiment. The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. They felt the timing was insensitive because the Black Watch was in the frontline in Iraq, suffering casualties. The Save the Scottish Regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against Labour at the next general election.\\n \\n Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: \"The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier. \"They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland\\'s regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.\" An alternative blueprint had been put forward by Labour MP Eric Joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely. Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. He said: \"They don\\'t want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.\" The prime minister said he hoped campaigners\\' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.\\n', 'summary': \"Military leaders are set to decide on restructuring Scotland's Army regiments, potentially merging six into one super regiment. This proposal has faced significant opposition from politicians and campaigners, citing concerns over local connections and heritage. An alternative plan suggested by a Labour MP aims to merge some regiments while preserving others. Prime Minister Tony Blair supports the idea of a super regiment, emphasizing the importance of flexibility in deployment while acknowledging the need to consider campaigners' concerns.\", 'explanation': 'The text discusses the impending decision by military chiefs regarding the restructuring of Scottish Army regiments. It highlights the controversy surrounding the proposal to reduce the number of regiments from six to five by creating a super regiment, which has elicited strong opposition due to concerns over loss of local identity and recruitment challenges. It also mentions alternative suggestions and comments made by political figures, notably Prime Minister Tony Blair, who stresses the need for both effective change and preservation of military traditions.'}, {'id': '2', 'content': 'Howard denies split over ID cards\\n \\n Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.\\n \\n The Tory leader said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n \\n Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n \\n He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don\\'t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n \\n Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n \\n They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people\\'s privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues\\' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n \\n The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven\\'t [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. He predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of Britain\\'s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.\\n', 'summary': \"Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative Party, denies any division within his shadow cabinet regarding support for Labour's controversial ID card plans, stating that a collective decision was made after thorough discussion. He believes ID cards could aid in combating terrorism and crime, despite acknowledging strong opposition from some senior party figures. Lib Dems plan to oppose the bill, and critics warn of potential societal harm and privacy invasion that could arise from the scheme.\", 'explanation': \"The summary encapsulates the key points of the article, highlighting Howard's defense of the Conservative party's stance on the ID card scheme despite internal dissent. It notes the concerns raised by opposition parties and figures within the Conservatives regarding civil liberties and the potential negative repercussions of implementing such a policy. The explanation provides context on the debate surrounding the ID card proposal and reflects the various viewpoints expressed within the political discourse.\"}], 'clusters': []}\n"
